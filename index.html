                What makes a good Kazoo?
            </h1>

            <h2>
                Resonance
            </h2>
            <img  src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/5A40D06C-47E1-44DC-B82ABCA72EF0C145_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&7E3BE80E-7F97-4185-8395708163A76701">
            <p>
                A kazoo’s resonance is arguably its most important feature.  Without the ability to produce noise, a Kazoo is nothing more than a fancy wind tube.  The slip of paper found at the end or on top of the kazoo is responsible for its angelic droning, and is susceptible to damage or over-use. 
            </p>

            <h2>
                Length
            </h2>
            <img  src="http://images.clipartpanda.com/disturbance-clipart-cub_energy2_lesson05_activity3_clip1.gif">
            <p>
                As important as a Kazoo’s resonance is its size.  If it is too large, a Kazoo can become unwieldy, and hard to play.  If it is too small, a Kazoo will be too high pitched, and hard to blow into.  As a result, the best Kazoos exist in a middle-ground of about 4 ¼ inches (thats .11 meters for our friends across the pond).
            </p>

            <h2>
                Material
            </h2>
            <img  src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQmruphyY0nN585ITw5cb8QYjWxh7ZZ74dnEPy3y4raj5Uqrd0d">
            <p>
                Metal, or plastic.  This question has plagued Kazooists for generations.  I personally prefer Kazoos of the plastic variety, as they do not leave a metallic taste on the lips and are typically less expensive.  Metal Kazoos have their own benefits too—a metal Kazoo is more durable and will last longer than a plastic one.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Durability
            </h2>
            <img  width="472px" height="354px" src="https://www.chimes.com/globalassets/product-images/large/kazoo2.jpg">
            <p>
                As I have already described, the body of metal Kazoos are more durable than those of plastic ones.  The paper responsible for the creation of sound, on the other hand, is similarly fragile in both forms of Kazoo—the main cause of damage is overwhelmingly filter-fatigue.  As a result, the most durable Kazoos have adequate protection for their paper membranes. 
            </p>

            <h2>
                Comfort
            </h2>
            <img width="472px" height="354px" src="http://www.neworleansclipart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/th_music1-01-e1492702194633.png">
            <p>
                In the end, the most important aspect of a Kazoo is its comfort.  The Kazoo, by its shitty design, is a fun instrument to play.  It makes a sound no better than humming, and is supremely silly.  If a Kazoo is uncomfortable, and by extension not enjoyable to play, the Kazoo has utterly failed its purpose.

                <p>
                    This Kazoo’s high durability and bold, thought-provoking, design put it at number 10 on my list, but it is the instruments poor comfort and resonance that ensure its relatively uncompetitive nature. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This Kazoo lets you play your part in ensuring the safety of this great nation’s sailors.  The Fog Horn was designed to be a gateway into the world of maritime safety for the everyday person.  As a piece with historical significance, this is one of my favorite Kazoos.  However, the modifications that were made to the standard plastic-Kazoo that give rise to its greatest strength (its volume), also present the greatest challenge with this Kazoo—it’s size.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dedicated to his late son, Kevin, the builder of this Kazoo did not have functionality in mind when designing this instrument.  Too large to play, this Kazoo breathes new life into the world of Kazoo building, but ultimately serves as a better memorial than instrument.

                <p>
                    At first glance, this Kazoo does not appear out-of-the-ordinary—just the standard, plastic Kazoo.  However, upon further inspection, one can see that the Electric Kazoo is anything but ordinary.  The Electric Kazoo is the most cutting-edge Kazoo on the market, and is the first in a new generation of techno-Kazoos.

                <p>
                    Much like Kevin, the Brass Kazoo is meant to be more looked at than played, but because of its stunning exterior design and intricate brass-work, I could not help but put it on my list.

                <p>
                    The Karzoo is not currently on the market.  This Kazoo is still under development at the same firm that designed the Electric Kazoo, but when finished, should be able to reach a top speed of 10 meters per second (thats 11 yards per second for you imperialists), faster than the average house-cat.

                <p>
                    Blue Steel is by far the most elegant instrument on this list.  Constructed entirely of sterling silver imported from southern Spain, this Kazoo is a whopping $350 (Thats 23,000 for the commies in the house) and can be found at www.musichouseshop.com (for real).

                <p>
                    This Kazoo’s value comes from its egalitarian nature.  Unlike the previous entry, this Kazoo is accessible to everyone.  Constructed out of a toilet-paper roll, a rubber band, and some tin-foil or waxed-paper, this Kazoo can be built in nearly every household.

                <p>
                    This Kazoo’s most striking characteristic is its small size, making it an optimal Kazoo for indoctrination.  Young children love this Kazoo, and it will foster a long-lasting love for the instrument in all who use it.

                    This Kazoo was found in the P.O. box of a Journalist working for The Atlantic in 1974, its creator is still unknown.  The sound of this Kazoo is unlike that of any other.  It is said that this Kazoo can stop a charging bull-elephant in its tracks, immediately placating any being who hears its divine humming.
